Chat GPT conversation:


The notes from your call cover some important concepts related to quantitative trading and machine learning in finance. Here's an explanation of the key points:

Key Idea #1: Using (Log) Returns Instead of Price
Concept: Stock prices are arbitrary and don't make for easy comparisons across different assets. Instead, using the percentage change in price (log returns) provides a more comparable metric. Log returns are preferred because they adjust for the scale of the stock price, making a +10 movement more impactful when a stock is priced at $100 compared to $1000.

Example: A stock moving from $100 to $110 is a 10% increase, while the same $10 move for a stock priced at $1000 would only be 1%. Log returns help express this difference clearly.
Code Comment: The use of MinMaxScaler (a scaling tool that normalizes data) can unintentionally incorporate future information into past data, which is a common pitfall in time series analysis. You need to avoid using future values to scale past data, as it can lead to "lookahead bias," meaning the model learns from information it shouldn’t have.

Key Idea #2: Risk Adjustment
Concept: In quantitative finance, a core question is determining the expected return per unit of risk. For stocks, risk is typically represented by volatility (the extent to which prices vary over time). While using log returns simplifies things, it assumes returns are normally distributed, which underestimates extreme events, but is a good starting point for a basic model.

Example: A highly volatile stock (high risk) is expected to have larger price swings, while a less volatile stock (low risk) should have more stable returns. Adjusting your model to account for this helps evaluate the risk-return trade-off.
Code Comment: Z-scoring features (standardizing by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) should only use information available at the time. This avoids "data leakage," where the model learns from future data it wouldn’t have access to in reality.

Key Idea #3: Focus on Features and Targets
Concept: Feature engineering—choosing and designing the input variables to the model—is often more impactful than tweaking the architecture of the model itself. The target variable and loss function you choose will drive the model's behavior.

Example: Mean Squared Error (MSE) vs. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). MSE penalizes larger errors more, which can cause a model to focus on reducing large deviations. MAPE, on the other hand, gives you relative errors, so it's better suited for situations where you care about percentage deviations (as in trading).
Code Comment: It's important to rigorously test your feature construction and model evaluation. While visual plots are useful, they don't give a quantitative measure of performance, so using metrics like Sharpe ratio or other financial performance indicators is key.

General ML Philosophy
Time Series Splitting: Time series data (like stock prices) needs a different approach to splitting into training, validation, and test sets. Rolling windows (where you retrain the model with more recent data) are ideal for financial models to reflect how markets evolve.

Out-of-sample Testing: The real measure of a model's success is how it performs on truly unseen data, so keeping an out-of-sample test set locked away until the final evaluation is crucial.

Benchmarking: Metrics are meaningless without comparing them to a sensible benchmark. In finance, comparing your model’s returns to something like the S&P 500 or a basic buy-and-hold strategy is common.

Recommendations
Build Custom Models: Instead of relying on pre-built ML libraries like Keras, consider building your own models from scratch to better understand the nuances of your data and improve your coding skills.

Factor Models: Look into equity factor models like Fama-French, which break down stock returns into different risk factors (market risk, size, value, etc.). Building basic factor portfolios and exploring ML’s application to factor timing (predicting which factors will outperform) can make your project stand out.

Yes, you can definitely use machine learning to build a system that reads in market data and calculates the relevant risk for each item traded in that market. This can be a great starting point for your project. Here’s a step-by-step outline of how you might approach it:

1. Collect Market Data
The first step is gathering historical price data (or returns) for the assets in the market. Sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or a professional data provider (Bloomberg, Quandl) can help with this.
You’ll need data such as:
Asset prices or returns over time.
Trading volume (which can be indicative of market interest).
Volatility indicators such as realized volatility or implied volatility from options markets.
2. Define Risk Metrics
Volatility: The most basic measure of risk for stocks. You can calculate it using the standard deviation of log returns over a specified period.
Value-at-Risk (VaR): Estimates the maximum expected loss over a specific time horizon with a given confidence level (e.g., a 95% VaR means there’s a 5% chance the loss will exceed this value).
Expected Shortfall (ES): Takes VaR one step further by estimating the average loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR threshold.
Beta: Measures the risk of an asset relative to the overall market.
Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure, dividing excess return by the asset's volatility.
3. Feature Engineering
You’ll need to create features that the machine learning model can use to estimate risk. Common features include:
Rolling window statistics: Such as rolling averages or standard deviations of returns (e.g., 30-day, 60-day).
Price momentum: The trend in price movement over recent periods.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Indicator used to measure the speed and change of price movements.
Bollinger Bands: Calculated using a moving average and standard deviation, to assess volatility.
Market conditions: Use macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates or commodity prices if relevant to the market.
4. Machine Learning Model
You could use supervised learning methods to predict risk (volatility, VaR, etc.) based on historical data:

Linear regression: Simple baseline model where you predict volatility based on historical returns.
Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): More powerful models that can capture complex relationships between your features and the target risk metrics.
Neural Networks: Could also be explored for their ability to detect patterns in highly dimensional data, though feature engineering would still be critical.
You could frame this as a regression problem, where the target is a risk metric (e.g., volatility, VaR) and the input features are various market data points (e.g., past returns, volume, etc.).

5. Validation and Testing
Use rolling windows for training and testing. For example, train your model on data from 2010-2019, and validate it on 2020. Then move the window forward by one year and repeat.
Keep a final set of data reserved as a true out-of-sample test to avoid overfitting.
6. Risk Calculation Algorithm
Once trained, your model would:

Read in new market data.
Calculate the rolling statistics (e.g., returns, volatility) and other engineered features in real-time.
Predict the current risk level for each asset based on the features.
If you want to measure volatility risk, you could have your model predict future volatility based on past behavior. Similarly, for VaR or expected shortfall, the model would predict the potential loss level.

7. Implementing a Feedback Loop
After deploying your model, you can implement a feedback loop where the model constantly updates its predictions as new data comes in (i.e., retrain periodically or update predictions in real-time).
Regularly compare predicted risks to realized risks to adjust and improve the model.
Tools and Libraries You Can Use:
Python: For data handling and machine learning.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Scikit-Learn: For traditional ML models like linear regression, random forests, etc.
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch: If you want to dive into deep learning.
Statsmodels: For statistical modeling (e.g., GARCH models for volatility).
Alphalens/pyfolio: Libraries for analyzing financial data.

Yes, you can certainly use your Radeon 7900 XTX to develop a machine learning model. While AMD GPUs aren’t as widely supported as NVIDIA for deep learning tasks (due to the dominance of CUDA, which is NVIDIA-specific), AMD has its own ecosystem for deep learning that you can leverage.

1. Using Your Radeon 7900 XTX
ROCm (Radeon Open Compute): AMD’s ROCm platform provides support for deep learning, and it includes libraries such as the ROCm equivalent of CUDA, allowing you to take advantage of your GPU’s power.
TensorFlow with ROCm: TensorFlow provides a ROCm build, meaning you can use your AMD GPU for training neural networks.
PyTorch also has some support for ROCm, so you could use that framework as well if needed. Since you're coding the model yourself, you'll need to set up ROCm correctly to make full use of the 7900 XTX.
2. Recommended Machine Learning Approach
Considering you're building your model from scratch, here are a few approaches depending on the type of risk prediction you want to focus on:

1. Linear and Statistical Models (Baseline)
These models are easier to implement and can give you a good benchmark before moving to more complex models.
Linear Regression: You can start with linear regression to predict volatility or risk based on historical returns, standard deviations, etc.
ARIMA/GARCH Models: If you want to predict volatility or model the risk in a time-series fashion, autoregressive models like GARCH are classic approaches in finance.
You can code these models manually without libraries, using mathematical principles.

2. Neural Networks
If you're aiming to create a more complex model from scratch using your GPU, then a Neural Network would be an ideal choice for time-series data like stock prices.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): You can start with a basic feedforward neural network for predicting risk metrics. Although simple, MLPs can be extended for more complex patterns.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNNs are ideal for sequential data. A vanilla RNN, or its more powerful variant, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), would be well-suited for predicting risk based on time-series market data.
Since you're coding this yourself, LSTMs may be a bit more challenging but provide the necessary architecture to handle dependencies between data points over time.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) can also be an alternative to LSTMs, and they are simpler to implement but still effective.
3. Transformer Models
For a more cutting-edge model, you could try transformer architectures, which have shown significant success in sequential data modeling, including time-series financial data.

Transformers can model complex relationships in time-series data more efficiently than RNNs. This would be a more advanced project but would demonstrate deep learning expertise. They’re more computationally demanding but your 7900 XTX can handle this with ROCm.
3. Steps for Building Your Own Model
Data Handling and Preprocessing:

Write your own code to handle the market data, generate features like log returns, rolling statistics, and risk indicators.
Make sure you handle train-test splits appropriately for time-series data (i.e., rolling window validation).
Model Architecture:

For a simple neural network, implement forward propagation and backpropagation manually. You’ll need to write functions for the activation functions (like ReLU, tanh), the loss function (MSE for regression), and the optimization algorithm (like gradient descent).
For RNN/LSTM, you’ll need to implement the recurrence step, where the hidden state is updated at each time step. In an LSTM, you'll implement gates for input, forget, and output, which control how much information is passed through each step.
Training:

Write your own training loop, where you iteratively calculate the loss, compute gradients, and update the model weights using your chosen optimization algorithm (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam).
With the 7900 XTX, you should be able to perform this on GPU using ROCm.
Risk Metric Prediction:

Have the model output risk metrics like volatility, VaR, or Sharpe ratio based on the input features you provide (historical returns, volume, etc.).
Since you’re coding this yourself, the flexibility will allow you to customize the output specifically for financial risk.
Performance Evaluation:

Test your model on out-of-sample data to see how well it generalizes.
Compare against simple benchmarks like historical volatility or basic statistical models (e.g., GARCH) to ensure your machine learning model adds value.
Conclusion
Yes, your Radeon 7900 XTX can be used to create this model with the ROCm platform, and given that you're coding the model from scratch, a neural network (RNN/LSTM) is a strong choice for sequential data like financial time-series. Starting with simpler models like linear regression or GARCH will give you a foundation, and you can then move on to neural networks or transformers for a more advanced and competitive model.
