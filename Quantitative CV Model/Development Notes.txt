I can use my GPU for neural networks and transformer models using AMD libraries!

Looks like a transformer model may be the most challenging but most rewarding to create since coding myself  -  check if libraries exist in Python so I can compare my results

As of 19/09/2024, I plan to create a linear regression model using the following factors to measure the risk for multiple assets in a market. Then after make a neural network or transformer model.


# Potential risk factors to measure

Volatility: The most basic measure of risk for stocks. You can calculate it using the standard deviation of log returns over a specified period.

Value-at-Risk (VaR): Estimates the maximum expected loss over a specific time horizon with a given confidence level (e.g., a 95% VaR means there’s a 5% chance the loss will exceed this value).

Expected Shortfall (ES): This takes VaR one step further by estimating the average loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR threshold.

Beta: Measures the risk of an asset relative to the overall market.

Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure, dividing excess return by the asset's volatility.

Once I have done this I will try to create a neural network or transformer model - although time is of the essence

# Feature Engineering Ideas

Volatility: Calculate rolling volatility (standard deviation of log returns) over a specific period (e.g., 30 days). This gives an estimate of the asset's risk.

Value-at-Risk (VaR): Use historical simulation or parametric VaR to estimate the maximum expected loss over a given time horizon (e.g., 95% VaR over 1 day).

Expected Shortfall (ES): Calculate the average loss in cases where the loss exceeds the VaR threshold.

Beta: Compute Beta by regressing the asset’s returns against the market index returns. Beta shows how sensitive the asset is to market movements.

Sharpe Ratio: Calculate the excess return (returns minus the risk-free rate) divided by the asset's volatility.


# Model Training 

To use MSE? Or out-of-sample Sharpe ratio for model training


# Model Evaluation

MAE? - Have used this in other projects


#### Beginning to create the model ####

First, I need to import the data, so choose a market, assets within the market and an API where I can get the measurements I need.

Welcome to Alpha Vantage! Your API key is: K9GL21GDULQVUWNM. Please record this API key in a safe place for future data access.

Let's use Yahoo Finance as it has a good API rate limit - il work out the measures - good to learn too

Let's go with the commodities market and focus on energy, as that's related to what I do as a job and could link to a potential energy price prediction innovation project we have coming up!

WTI Crude Oil (West Texas Intermediate): 'CL=F'
Brent Crude Oil: 'BZ=F'
Natural Gas: 'NG=F'
Heating Oil: 'HO=F'
Gasoline (RBOB): 'RB=F'

I am getting inf values in my log data for price movement, so I am removing them and forward filling the data - not sure if I should replace with 0 - one to review

As I am trying to create a model which 'trades' multiple assets at once for small gains I am going to move away from energy commodities.

Not sure to 'trade' stocks as so many things can influence them. I might stick with macro-influenced items such as forex or commodities - hmmmmmmmmm 

To create benchmarks of returns I am going to use the SNP 500 - is this a good idea? bonds better - to review


Having NaN problems when working out all of these indicators - I see why people pay for them to be provided lol
